## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile, where the code flows, and sometimes, **segfaults** do too. Youâ€™ll find a quick summary of my stats and the technologies I wield with precision. But don't mistake this for casual codingâ€”this is where serious developers reside. 

### Most used languages
As every real programmer knows: **you're not a true developer until you've faced a segfault**. Only then do you truly understand the limits of memory and the consequences of improper access.
