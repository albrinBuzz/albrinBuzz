## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile, where the code flows smoothly... until it doesn't. Sometimes, **segfaults** are just a reminder that even the most carefully crafted code can stumble when you try to reach the forbidden. 

### Most used languages
As every true developer knows: **you're not a real developer until you've faced a segfault**. Itâ€™s the moment you realize that, just like a hacker trying to break into a secure system, you have to understand the rules of memory or risk getting caught.
